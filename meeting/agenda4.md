DoorDet: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07714

This paper uses LLM to classify door instances into functional categories. But not use LLM to generate new images.

### Question

1. some feedback about literature review?
1. about research proposal, we talked about LoRA in advance. To my understand, we use real road images (how to get?) to train  a LoRA module, enabling the model to generate more realistic images.
1. should I add Timeline and Milestones in RP?
1. What should the final research proposal format look like? Should the literature review be just a subsection of it?
