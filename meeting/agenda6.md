## Automated Workflow

Extend the current ComfyUI pipeline into a fully automated batch-processing workflow, enabling consistent generation, filtering, and annotation across datasets.

### Question

1. Since next week is a university holiday, should we skip the next group meeting?
1. Last time we mentioned that meetings will continue weekly after November. I plan to return to China for one month in January for the New Year — would that be okay?
1. I still haven’t received any information about my presentation. Should I send an email to ask about it?
1. In last Tuesday’s CSIRO welcome session, they mentioned that the funding has already been transferred to the university. Since I haven’t received the scholarship yet, should I email Stop 1 to check?
